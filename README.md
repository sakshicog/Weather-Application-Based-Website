# Weather-Application-Based-Website
Weather Application Based Website(Front-end(HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API Keys))
Weather forecasting is essential for planning daily activities, travel, agriculture, and disaster management. This project focuses on developing a weather-based application website that provides real-time weather updates for a given location. The application fetches weather details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions using an API and displays them in a user-friendly interface.

This project enhances user experience by ensuring smooth UI/UX, a responsive search feature, and proper handling of errors like invalid location inputs.
The application provides accurate weather insights to help users make informed decisions.
